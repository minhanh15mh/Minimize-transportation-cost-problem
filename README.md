Problem: 

While the shipping cost may be lower between certain plants and distribution centers, Meko has established shipping routes between every plant and every warehouse. This is in case of unforeseen problems such as a forced shutdown at a plant, unanticipated swings in regional demands, or poor weather along some routes.

The Shipping Costs per 1000 units in $: 

  From: Hai Duong, Dong Nai, Binh Duong - To: Ha Noi, Da Nang, HCMC,	Can Tho respectively.

 Data: 
   [[250	420	380	280], [1280	990	1440	1520], [1550	1420	1660	1730]]

The production of plant: 

Plant: Hai Duong, Dong Nai, Binh Duong with	Anticipated
Production (1000s): 45, 120, 95 respectively.
	
The Warehouse	Shipment quantity (1000s): 
[[Ha Noi: 80],
[Da Nang:	78],
[HCMC:	47],
[Can Tho:	55]]

The goal is to determine a pattern of shipping that minimizes the total transportation cost from plants to warehouses.

a.	Develop mathematical model for this case (with Index Set, Parameters, Decision Variables, Objective Function & Constraint set).

b.	Use optimization tools (e.g., Excel Solver/CPLEX/Lingo) to find the optimal pattern of shipping that minimize the total transportation cost from plants to warehouses (an Excel file or CPLEX/Lingo code should be included).

c.	From above optimal shipping pattern, conclude the minimized total transportation cost.
